# Vanilla-Revamped
Overview

This is a datapack/resourcepack combo that adds new items, structures, loot, and music to the game. While currently in development my plans are to continue to improve Minecraft's base exploration, add new items, offer some quality of life (QOL) changes, and make the vanilla experience feel fresh and revamped.

New Recipies

Copper Armor Netherite Paxel Katana Music Disc - Voyage

New Structures

Plans to add some naturally generating structures in the future!

New Biomes

Possibility of adding new Biomes!

New QOL Changes

Plans to add smelting of raw ore blocks.

Installing the Pack

To install this pack simply put the datapack in the datapack folder of your world (found if your saves folder). And activate the resourcepack by putting it in your resourcepacks folder and then activating it in game.
